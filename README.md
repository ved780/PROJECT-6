# Task 6 – Password Strength Evaluation

This repository contains my work for **Task 6** of the Cybersecurity Internship program.  
The objective was to create multiple passwords with varying complexity, test them using online password strength tools, and document the findings.

---

## 📌 Objective
Understand the characteristics of a strong password, evaluate them against common attacks, and apply best practices in password creation.

---

## 📂 Contents
- **Task6_Password_Strength_Report.txt** – Detailed evaluation report of passwords tested, observations, and best practices.
- **Screenshots/** – Images showing password strength test results.
- **README.md** – This file.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com) – for password strength testing.
- Text editor for documentation.

---

## 🔍 Summary of Work
1. Created five passwords with different levels of complexity.
2. Tested each password for strength score and received feedback.
3. Compared results to identify patterns and weaknesses.
4. Documented best practices to make passwords resistant to brute force and dictionary attacks.

## 📖 Key Takeaways
- Longer passwords with mixed case, numbers, and symbols significantly improve security.
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns.
- Passphrases made of random, unrelated words can be both secure and easy to remember.
- Password managers are useful for generating and storing strong passwords securely.
