Password Strength Evaluation Report

Internship Task: 6 – Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
Intern Name: Ved Vyas
Date: 14/08/2025

1. Introduction
This report documents the process of creating multiple passwords with varying levels of complexity, evaluating them using an online password strength checker, and summarizing the best practices learned. The purpose is to understand how password structure impacts security against common attacks such as brute force and dictionary attacks.

2. Methodology
1. Created five passwords with different characteristics:
   - Short & simple
   - Medium length with mixed case
   - Longer with numbers
   - Complex with symbols
   - Strong passphrase style
2. Tested each password using PasswordMeter.com.
3. Recorded the strength score and feedback for each password.
4. Analysed results to extract best practices.

3. Passwords & Strength Results

Password Example      | Length | Complexity Elements                  | Score (%) | Feedback Summary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pass123               | 7      | Lowercase + numbers                   | 28%       | Too short, predictable, lacks symbols
PassWord2025          | 12     | Mixed case + numbers                  | 52%       | Better, but still predictable words
P@ssW0rd#2025         | 13     | Mixed case + numbers + symbols        | 78%       | Stronger, but uses common word patterns
gH9@Xy!qT3$Lp         | 14     | Fully random, mixed elements          | 94%       | Very strong, hard to guess
"coffee train moon"   | 18     | Passphrase, spaces, random words      | 88%       | Strong and memorable

4. Observations
- Length greatly improves security, even with moderate complexity.
- Symbols and numbers significantly boost strength scores.
- Common dictionary words weaken password security, even when mixed with numbers.
- Passphrases can achieve high security while remaining easier to remember.

5. Best Practices Learned
- Use at least 12–16 characters.
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid common dictionary words, patterns, and personal information.
- Consider passphrases made of random, unrelated words.
- Change passwords regularly and avoid reusing them across platforms.

6. Understanding Common Attacks
- Brute Force Attack: Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found. Longer and more complex passwords take exponentially longer to crack.
- Dictionary Attack: Uses lists of common words and phrases to guess passwords. Avoiding predictable words helps defend against this.

7. Conclusion
The evaluation confirms that a strong password is long, complex, and unpredictable. Random combinations or passphrases significantly improve security. This exercise reinforced the importance of good password hygiene as the first line of defense against unauthorized access.
